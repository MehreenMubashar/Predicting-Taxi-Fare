# Predicting Taxi Fare

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting taxi fares based on relevant features extracted from a dataset containing information about taxi rides. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of estimating taxi fares accurately.

## Task

The main tasks involved in this project are as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the distribution and relationships of key variables such as fare amounts, trip distances, and time of day.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Model Development:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model that can forecast taxi fares based on input features.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics and refine it as necessary to enhance accuracy.
